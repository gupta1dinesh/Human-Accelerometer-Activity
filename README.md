# Human-Accelerometer-Activity-Recognition

How do different frame size of accelerometers and their classification accuracy scores vary?
Answer to this question was explored at 3, 6, 9 window frame size for the classification of human activities 
Human activities from accelerometer data (data collected at wrist, hip, ankle) like walking, descending_stairs, ascending_stairs, and driving  have been  classified at three-frame size  using a convolutional neural network
